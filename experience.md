# üìå Experience
**Hello!**
**I'm Yevheniia Monastyrna.**
**Here‚Äôs a more focused, detailed breakdown of my experience:**

### üîó 1. Blockchain Development & Smart Contracts
- I have been developing and optimizing smart contracts using **Solidity** on EVM-compatible networks.
- Hands-on experience with **DeFi protocols**: working with liquidity pools, implementing vesting schedules, staking mechanisms, and optimizing gas usage by refactoring smart contracts.
- Created and improved **Bridge smart contracts** for Ulron projects, managing data integration with backend and frontend teams.
- Integrated with protocols like **RainDex, Compound,** and **Gnosis Safe**.
- Actively improving **smart contract security**, mitigating vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks and integer overflows using tools like **Slither, MythX, SWC Registry**, and **OpenZeppelin** libraries.
- Was involved in the creation of a new **DSL language** based on Solidity. RainDex is a strong competitor in this space, with better investments and a more effective MVP marketing strategy.

### üñ•Ô∏è 2. Backend Development (Python, TypeScript, Django, DRF, Node.js)
- Built scalable backends using **Django REST Framework** for platforms handling **crypto payments** and event management. Worked with PostgreSQL and PostGIS for logistics projects.
- Developed **API endpoints** to listen to blockchain events (using **Node.js** and **TypeScript**) for the integration with smart contracts, stored needed data and upgraded and improved the exist complex services.
- Migrated legacy **Django projects** from **Python 2 to Python 3**, ensuring compatibility and improved performance.
- Optimized caching mechanisms using **Redis** and **Cloudflare Workers** for high-performance, low-latency responses.
- Contributed to the development of voting mechanisms and token-based decision-making systems

### üõ†Ô∏è 3. Web3 & Full-Stack Integration
- Deploying and maintaining **Cloudflare Workers** for enhanced edge computing capabilities using **TypeScript** for serverless deployments.
- Established **WebSocket connections** for real-time updates in dApps, ensuring data consistency and fast response times.
- Collaborated with frontend and DevOps teams to integrate blockchain data using **React** and **Next.js**, optimizing Web3 interactions and fixing subgraph queries.
- Leveraged The Graph for on-chain data analysis and insights.
  
### ü§ù 4. Project Management & Client Interaction
- Led projects involving **multi-chain smart contract deployments** (e.g., Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc).
- Managed cross-functional teams of frontend and backend developers, streamlining workflows to meet tight deadlines.
- Regularly interacted with clients, providing project demos, and aligning technical solutions with business requirements, especially for clients in **France, the UK, Belarus, Canada,** and the **USA**.
- Worked on internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) for dApps to support multiple languages.

### üõ°Ô∏è 5. Testing & Code Quality
- Conducted thorough **smart contract audits** using **Foundry, Hardhat,** and **Truffle** testing suites, utilizing mainnet forking to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Implemented pre-deployment audits and testing frameworks to identify vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols.
- Wrote and maintained **unit tests** and **integration tests** for Python/Django projects to ensure reliability and stability.
- Implemented **CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployment and testing using **GitHub Actions**.
- Created use cases, documentation, interfaces, and diagrams for various purposes.
  
### üìö 6. Current Learning & Development
- Exploring **Solana smart contract development** with Rust, recognizing the growing demand in the market.
- Learning **Japanese** to open up opportunities for collaboration with clients in Japan in the future.
